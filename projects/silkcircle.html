            <h2>The lack of awareness of garment waste and issues related to fast fashion </h2>
            <p>The problem that we wanted to address was the issue of <b>ast fashion and its negative impact on the environment.</b>f We wanted to create an app that could inform individuals about the environmental effect of the garments they own and encourage them to make more sustainable clothing purchasing practices.</p><br>

            <h2>Use user research to guide the product direction</h2>
                <p>To create the app, we conducted preliminary research on the issue of sustainable fashion. We explored related issues and learned more about the fashion industry, its impact on the environment, and the consequences of human actions. <b>We conducted two surveys to verify the impact of our app on our testers.</b> <br><br>The first survey was completed to learn more about what they already knew about the fashion industry, and the second was completed after interacting with the app. The objective was to <b> verify if the users had more general knowledge</b> and intentions of changing their clothing consumption habits.

                <h2>Find a common ground in user goals and business goals</h2>
                <p>Initially, we planned to develop a platform for buying and selling clothes to promote a sustainable circular economy. However, we shifted our focus to educating users about the clothing industry to raise awareness and encourage sustainable purchasing practices. Our goal is to spark a change in behavior and intentions. <b>Our research question is: How can technology promote sustainable clothing purchasing practices?</b>"</p>

            <h2>Use strategies to help users maximize their learning</h2>
            <p>There are multiple ways to measure whether users are maximizing their learning experience in Silk Circle: Such as how many garments they added to their closet, the improvement of their closet score etc. <b>Those features are strategies to achieve the goals of the app through design.</b>

          <h2>Creating an awesome reading experience through visual design</h2>
          <p>We decided to use Inter for all the typography in this app, because I want a typeface that everyone finds familiar and has great legibility. We also used different font weights, colors, and sizes to create a clear information hierarchy.</p>

            <h3 id='s6' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>

                <p>The creation of the app was a challenging process, and we had to make some changes to our initial project idea and research question. However, through our research and design process, we were able to create an app that addresses the core of our research question and encourages sustainable clothing purchasing practices. We believe that our app will help people to become more aware of the issues of fast fashion and take action towards a more sustainable future. Three main lessons I learned from this project are: 
                </p>
          <ul class="text-list">
                <li>The sky is the limit, but with technical and time constraints, I learned to <b>prioritize features that provide most value to users</b>;</li>
                <li>Consider <b>human factors</b> to enhance the UX: the “fat finger” problem, Fitts’ Law;</li>
                <li><b>Visual design is a crucial part of the overall experience</b>, especially when the function of the app is heavily dependent on the information hierarchy and legibility of the content.</li>
                </ul>
