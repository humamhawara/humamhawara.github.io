                <p>Inspired by Starbucks' idea when they posted a link to a playlist and some
                    pictures of their coffeeshops at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. KREMAER
                    allows you to get in the coffee shop vibe without leaving your desk. KREAMER is
                    a phone app that works as a virtual coffee shop where users can pick a local
                    coffee shop and listen to a soundtrack that the coffee shop manager uploaded
                    while looking at a picture of the coffee shop. The app also offers chat and
                    tap&talk features with active friends.</p>

                    <h3 id='s2' class='section'>PROBLEM SPACE</h3>
                    <h2>Losing the motivation to work and the sense of community in a world wide pandemic</h2>
                    <p>Many people enjoy going to coffee shops to work, socialize, or relax. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many coffee shops to close, limiting people's opportunities to visit their favorite places. Additionally, some people might not have access to coffee shops due to their location or time constraints. KREAMER aims to solve this problem by <b>providing a virtual coffee shop experience</b> that can be accessed from anywhere at any time.</b>.
                    </p>

                    <div class="space15px"></div>
                    <h3 id='s3' class='section'>DEFINING GOALS</h3>
                    <p> I defined three main goals of the App:<br>
                        1.
                        <b>Community based</b>
                        to have the local community gather somewhere virtual when the entire world locked down<br>
                        2.
                        <b>Encourage</b>
                        students and remote workers to keep working since it was so much harder to work<br>
                        3.
                        <b>Build a connection</b>
                        with users from local communities to expand their network
                    </p>

                    <div class="space15px"></div>
                    <h3 id='s4' class='section'>Design process</h3>
                    <h2>Based on the user research, I designed a user interface that is simple, intuitive, and customizable.</h2> <p>The app's main screen shows a list of local coffee shops, sorted by distance, rating, or popularity. Users can tap on a coffee shop to view a picture of the shop, a brief description, and the soundtrack uploaded by the manager. The soundtrack can be played, paused, skipped, or customized by the user. The chat and tap&talk features allow users to interact with their friends or other users who are also using the app. The app also provides a loyalty program that rewards users for visiting their favorite coffee shops.</p>

                    <p>I used <b>Agile Method </b> as a way to create this MVP as shown in the process below</p>

                    </p>

                    <h3 id='s5' class='section'>Usability Testing
                    </h3>
                    <h2> identify usability issues, user preferences, and areas for improvement</h2>
                    <p>As Herbert Simon famously said, "what information consumes is rather obvious:
                        it consumes the attention of its recipients." Below are some major design
                        decisions I made to direct users' attention:<br><br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What does a user need in a virtual work session?</b><br><br>
                        From asking and interviewing family, freinds and peer, the main features that seemed important to have are:
                        <b>Audio</b>, <b>Timer</b>,and a <b>Chat</b> feature to not interrupt the session.
                        With the "coffeeshop soundtrack" audio as the main feature of the app, it is meant to 
                        <b>increase productivity</b>, and all the other features are there to support that main goal, thus all those features are displayed when user clicks on a coffee shop<br></p>
