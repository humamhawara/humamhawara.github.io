                <p>Inspired by Starbucks' idea when they posted a link to a playlist and some
                    pictures of their coffeeshops at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. KREMAER
                    allows you to get in the coffee shop vibe without leaving your desk. KREAMER is
                    a phone app that works as a virtual coffee shop where users can pick a local
                    coffee shop and listen to a soundtrack that the coffee shop manager uploaded
                    while looking at a picture of the coffee shop. The app also offers chat and
                    tap&talk features with active friends.</p>

                    <h2>Use design to showcase the researcher's work, engage users, and build
                        credibility</h2>
                    <p>This is a passion project I worked on with a CMU Ph.D. student, Annabel Sun.
                        Her research is about extracting the most important statements from Terms &
                        Conditions so that consumers don't have to peruse 20 pages of policies and can
                        focus on the most important ones. My role was to rebuild the website so that it
                        best presents her work, builds credibility, and engages users
                        <b>through rapid prototyping and testing</b>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id='s3' class='section'>DEFINING GOALS</h3>
                    <p> I defined three main goals of the App:<br>
                        1.
                        <b>Community based</b>
                        to have the local community gather somewhere virtual when the entire world locked down<br>
                        2.
                        <b>Encourage</b>
                        students and remote workers to keep working since it was so much harder to work<br>
                        3.
                        <b>Build a connection</b>
                        with users from local communities to expand their network
                    </p>

                    <div class="space15px"></div>
                    <h3 id='s4' class='section'>DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
                    <h2>An iterative process focused on usability and effective communication</h2>
                    <p>I focused on testing the usability of the site and how well the presented
                        information communicates to visitors. It was an iterative process. With the
                        three defined project goals in mind, we collected feedback from users, extracted
                        insights, updated the design, and repeated.</p>

                    <h3 id='s5' class='section'>DESIGN DECISIONS</h3>
                    <h2>Direct user attention to what's important</h2>
                    <p>As Herbert Simon famously said, "what information consumes is rather obvious:
                        it consumes the attention of its recipients." Below are some major design
                        decisions I made to direct users' attention:<br><br>
                        <br>
                        <b>What does a user need in a virtual work session?</b><br><br>
                        From asking and interviewing family, freinds and peer, the main features that seemed important to have are:
                        <b>Audio</b>, <b>Timer</b>,and a <b>Chat</b> feature to not interrupt the session.
                        With the "coffeeshop soundtrack" audio as the main feature of the app, it is meant to 
                        <b>increase productivity</b>, and all the other features are there to support that main goal, thus all those features are displayed when user clicks on a coffee shop<br></p>
                    <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img
                            class="project-img-med"
                            src="../assets/CrowdVerify/audio.png"
                            alt="CrowdVerify Hero">
                    </div>
                    <h4></h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Make "Contribute to Our Research" a call-to-action</b><br><br>
                        This is an important call to action, but while testing the old design, some
                        users didn't even notice it. It was neither taking enough real estate, nor
                        drawing much attention. I added the call-to-action on the hero section and
                        created a new section, not the homepage to allow visitors to compare terms
                        without going to another page. This helps reduce churning.</p>
                    <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img

                    <b><br>
                        <p>Simplify the list of analyzed companies</b><br><br>
                        In our studies, we found that users actually won't read through the entire list.
                        And there is no reason they need to. Simply showing some recognizable company
                        icons will evoke interest to see more.</p>

                    <h2>An approachable visual system that builds trust</h2>
                    <p>For a site that informs people about legal policies, establishing
                        trustworthiness is crucial. At the same time, the visual style also needs to
                        appear friendly and engaging.
                    </p>
                    <p>Regarding color choices, I chose purple-blue-turquoise gradients. The blue
                        create a professional identity, yet the unconventional hues added a modern/techy
                        touch. The typeface, Open Sans, creates a credible and approachable aura.</p>

                    <p>I acted as a design consultant and worked directly with the owner of the
                        research project. Since I only had about 10 days to design and deliver code,
                        <b>project management and effective communication were crucial.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Because of time constraint, we had to make compromises</b>: sometimes it
                        means changing the design to make it easier to code and sometimes it means
                        postponing certain functions due to technical difficulties. The website is not
                        perfect. For example, the search bar doesn't yet show the text "no results
                        found" when the situation occurs. The interaction of the individual company
                        pages is not optimal. With limited time and resource,
                        <b>prioritization is necessary to ensure the timely delivery of the product.</b>
                    </p>
